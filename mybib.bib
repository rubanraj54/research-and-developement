	Abstract = {Robotic applications generate huge amount of data from sensors and often data is stored locally in the robot and most of the times data has been discarded after extracting meaningful information from it. Developers in the robotic community store these sensor data in the form of text files, log files or ROS bags and use them in future for navigation, manipulation, fault diagnosis, etc,. But there are potential disadvantages in storing data locally and, the way data are stored and queried. To address this issue, we study the existing solutions from available databases to handle robot sensor data. In this research work, a set of databases will be selected from different categories like RDBMS, NoSQL, Graph, and Column oriented, and qualitative and quantitative analysis will be conducted under different configurable test cases. The results from this research work will give the best practices for when to use which database, which data model should be considered and, insights of best database architectures, replication strategies and conflict resolution policies.},
